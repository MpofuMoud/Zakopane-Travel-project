            <h3>Zakopane, the city of mountains</h3>
            <p>
              Zakopane is a town in the south of Poland, in the southern part of
              the Podhale region at the foot of the Tatra Mountains
            </p>
            <p>
              Zakopane is a centre of Goral culture and is often referred to as
              "the winter capital of Poland". It is a popular destination for
              mountaineering, skiing, and tourism. Zakopane lies near Poland's
              border with Slovakia, in a valley between the Tatra Mountains and
              Gubałówka Hill. It is connected by rail and road to the provincial
              capital, Kraków. Zakopane lies 800–1,000 metres above sea level
              and centres on the intersection of its Krupówki and Kościuszko
              Streets.

                  Kasprowy Wierch is one of the most recognizable mountains in
                  the Tatras. This peak, located on the border of the High and

                  Czerwone Wierchy and of the much sharper peaks of the High
                  Tatras.
